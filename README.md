# MRI_PD_TensorFlow

This repository describes my efforts to train a convolutional neural network to classify between imaging of Parkinson's Disease and healthy, age-matched patients. 

The dataset can be found here: https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/parkinsons.html. It includes T1-MRIs and resting-state fMRIs of 47 PD patients and 36 age-matched healthy patients. For now, we will focus on the T1-MRI images.
